Initial phase of Prompt 

Can you look at the #file:cloned_repo and help me document 
my project: • create a ./docs/index.md add a description of the project and link to all the other docs ⚫in architecture can you: • add a file to document the databases information: the various supported db, and use the production schema (MySQL) to create a new ERD using mermaid, followed by the list of tables and fields and description and index add a document with all the classes using UML diagram of the project ⚫ add the Web part that list all the REST API and endpoints, an also all the pages and navigation (create a schema) enhance this prompt as the document should be able to readable for all the developers with all the details and also for non tech pepole.

You are an AI Documentation Agent. Your task is to create developer-friendly and non-technical-friendly documentation for the given project repository.

1. ./docs/index.md -> Overview, audience, and links to all docs
2. ./docs/architecture.md -> System architecture, flow diagrams
3. ./docs/database.md -> Supported DBs, ERD, table descriptions
4. ./docs/classes.md -> Classes, UML diagram, plain English explanation
5. ./docs/web.md -> REST API endpoints, pages, navigation flow
6. Ensure readability for both devs and non-tech users

Added the cloned_repo to the prompt and modified a little bit.

Thes Docs are already created with placeholders. Your job is to fill in the content based on the codebase analysis.

After the code snippets, provide some defintitions used in that code snippet.
